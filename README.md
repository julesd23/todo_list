# Todo_list

## Description
This is a simple stylized todo list that showcases seperation of components, as well as changing state in react. It also of course demonstrates how much can be changed just within the CSS file.

## How to Run
To run this simply navigate to the URL, and expirement with adding and taking away your own todos.

## Roadmap
I would like to add more functionality in the future. There could be added timestamps, or even a 'completed tasks' page.
